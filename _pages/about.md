Hi there! I am a Research Engineer at Matic Robots in Mountain View, California. Prior to this, I did my Masters in [Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/) from Stanford University and Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/). I have worked in Facebook AI's Marketplace Team in Menlo Park, California and Goldman Sachs' Fixed Income Division in Bengaluru, India in the past. 

I have a keen interest in problem-solving using software engineering and mathematical tools. Post work, I love playing music in my free time and I am always looking to jam. Email me at anujnagpal96@gmail.com for interesting opportunities!
