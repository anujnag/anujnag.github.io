Hi there! I am an AI Engineer in LinkedIn working on Trust and Anti-Abuse problems. I finished my Masters in [Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/) from Stanford University and Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/). Prior to my current role, I have worked in an indoor robotics startup in Mountain View called Matic Robots. During grad school, I got the opportunity to work in Meta's (then Facebook)  Marketplace Team in Menlo Park, California. Between grad school and undergrad, I worked as an Associate writing Fixed Income trading algorithms and infrastructure in Goldman Sachs' Bangalore office in India.

I have been always interested in solving problems using algorithmic and mathematical skills, which later translated to interest in solving computational problems. Post work, I love playing music in my free time and I am always looking to jam on anything rock, indie, and metal. Email me at anujnagpal96@gmail.com for interesting opportunities!
