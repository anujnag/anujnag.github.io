Hi there, welcome to my homepage! I am currently a master's student in Stanford University, majoring in Computational and Mathematical Engineering. I did my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kanpur. I have worked in Facebook AI's Marketplace Team in Menlo Park and Goldman Sachs' Fixed Income Division in Bengaluru collaborating with trading desks in London and New York. My current academic interests revolve around natural language processing, reinforcement learning, deep generative models, quantiative finance and graph machine learning. Apart from my academic interests, I love playing music and I love to jam on guitar in my free time :) Email works best for contacting me!
