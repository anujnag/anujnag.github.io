I"¼<p>Main agenda of writing this note is to check if I can write basic latex equations, include proportionate images and give refernces and tags.</p>

<p>Distance from Means Classifier is the most trivial and easiest to understand machine learning algorithm.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Given \(N\) labeled training examples \(\{ x_n, y_n \}\) from two classes, say positive and negative, we want to learn a model to predict label or class \(y\) for a new test example \(x\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Model:</strong> Assign \(x\) to class with closer mean (note that the same idea can be extended to more than 2 classes)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>How does it look mathematically</p>

<p>If \(N_{+}\) examples form positive class and \(N_{-}\) examples form negative class, mean of each class can be written as</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\mu_{+} = \frac{1}{N_{+}} \sum_{y_n = + 1} x_n \quad and \quad \mu_{-} = \frac{1}{N_{-}} \sum_{y_n = - 1} x_n
\end{equation}\]

<p>Distances from each mean will be then:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
|| \mu_{+} - x ||^2 = || \mu_{+} ||^2 + || x ||^2 - 2 &lt; \mu_{+}, x &gt; \\
|| \mu_{-} - x ||^2 = || \mu_{-} ||^2 + || x ||^2 - 2 &lt; \mu_{-}, x &gt;
\end{equation}\]

<p>This is a test note, so I am leaving it just here.</p>
